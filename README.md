A small and fast GraphQL client for Vue.js.

This is forked from my previous work at [vue-gql](https://github.com/baianat/vue-gql) before they decide to go for a different direction with this library.

## Features

- 📦 **Minimal:** Its all you need to query GQL APIs.
- 🦐 **Tiny:** Very small footprint.
- 🗄 **Caching:** Simple and convenient query caching by default.
- 💪 **TypeScript**: Written in Typescript.
- 💚 Minimal Vue.js Components.
- 🖇 Composition API support.

**It is Vue 3.0-ready!**

## Why use this

GraphQL is just a simple HTTP request. This library is meant to serve a tiny client without all the bells and whistles attached to Apollo and its ecosystem, it offers simple strategies to cache and batch your GraphQL requests.

If you are looking for a more full-featured client use [vue-apollo](https://github.com/vue/vue-apollo), it has everything you need.

You can read more about it in the [announcement post](https://logaretm.com/blog/2020-01-11-announcing-villus/).

## Documentation

You can find the full [documentation here](https://logaretm.github.io/villus)

## Quick Start

First install `villus`:

```bash
yarn add villus@next graphql

# or npm

npm install villus@next graphql --save
```

> If you are using Vue 2 with the @vue/composition-api don't use the `next` tag.

You can now use it with either the new Vue composition API or higher order components:

### Composition API

Configure the GraphQL client for your root component:

```js
import { useClient } from 'villus';

export default {
  name: 'App',
  setup() {
    useClient({
      url: 'http://localhost:3002/graphql'
    });
  }
};
```

Then you can use `useQuery` in any child component:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <div v-if="data">
      <pre>{{ data }}</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { useQuery } from 'villus';

export default {
  setup() {
    const { data } = useQuery({
      query: '{ posts { title } }'
    });

    return { data };
  }
};
</script>
```

There is also the higher-order component flavor if you prefer to use them instead. Check the docs for more examples and details.

---

You can do a lot more than that, `villus` makes frequent tasks such as re-fetching, caching, mutations, and subscriptions a breeze. Consult the documentation for more use-cases and examples.

## Compatibility

This library relies on the `fetch` web API to run queries, you can use [`unfetch`](https://github.com/developit/unfetch) (client-side) or [`node-fetch`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) (server-side) to use as a polyfill.
