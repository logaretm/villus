## Quick Start

First install `villus`:

```sh
yarn add villus graphql

# or npm

npm install villus graphql --save
```

### Usage

Configure the GraphQL client for your root component:

```vue
<script setup>
import { useClient } from 'villus';

useClient({
  url: 'http://localhost:3002/graphql',
});
</script>
```

Then you can use `useQuery` in any child component:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <div v-if="data">
      <pre>{{ data }}</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { useQuery } from 'villus';

const { data } = useQuery({
  query: '{ posts { title } }',
});
</script>
```
