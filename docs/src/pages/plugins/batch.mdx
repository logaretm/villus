# Query Batching

Villus has support for query batching but it is not configured out of the box, this is because not all GraphQL implementations support query-batching. So you would need to manually import it and configure it with `villus` client.

The batch plugin is available as its own package under the name `@villus/batch`

## Basic Batching

First add the plugin to your dependencies using `yarn` or `npm`:

```bash
yarn add @villus/batch
# Or
npm install @villus/batch
```

Then import the `batch` plugin from `villus` and pass it at the very end of the `plugins` array in client configuration:

```vue
<script setup>
import { useClient } from 'villus';
import { batch } from '@villus/batch';

useClient({
  url: 'https://test.com/graphql',
  use: [batch()],
});
</script>
```

<DocTip type="danger">
  Careful not to use `batch` with the default `fetch` plugin, both of them act as a fetcher and there can only be 1
  fetcher plugin for `villus` at any given time.
</DocTip>

And that's it, all your nested components that use `useQuery` or `useMutation` will automatically be batched together in a single request:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <ul v-if="postsWithTitle">
      <li v-for="post in postsWithTitle.posts" :key="post.id">{{ post.title }}</li>
    </ul>
    <ul v-if="postsWithId">
      <li v-for="post in postsWithId.posts" :key="post.id">{{ post.title }}</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { useQuery } from 'villus';

// Both will be sent in a single request
const firstQuery = useQuery('{ posts { title } }');
const secondQuery = useQuery('{ posts { id } }');
</script>
```

## Batching timeout

Batching is done by waiting for a specific time which is `10ms` by default since the last executed query, and all queries executed within this time window will be batched together.

You can configure that time window by passing a `timeout` option to the `batch` function configuration:

```vue{7}
<script setup>
import { useClient } from 'villus';
import { batch } from '@villus/batch';

useClient({
  url: 'https://test.com/graphql',
  use: [batch({ timeout: 50 })],
});
</script>
```

This will add a `50ms` time window between queries to be batched together.

## Batched operations limit

You can also introduce a limit on how many operations can be executed in a batch. Usually this is a good idea to make sure you don't include a lot of operations in a single batch which could have inverse effect on performance since the total execution time now depends on all the operations being executed.

You can configure the batch limit by passing a `maxOperationCount` option to the `batch` function configuration:

```vue{7}
<script setup>
import { useClient } from 'villus';
import { batch } from '@villus/batch';

useClient({
  url: 'https://test.com/graphql',
  use: [batch({ maxOperationCount: 5 })],
});
</script>
```

By default it is `10`.

## Options

You can customize a few aspects of the `batch` plugin:

The available options are:

| Option            | Type                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| fetch             | `typeof window.fetch` | Pass this option if you plan to be specific about the `fetch` polyfill that will be used, by default it tries to find `window.fetch` on the browser or `global.fetch` on Node.js depending on the execution environment |
| timeout           | `number`              | The number of milliseconds to wait for before executing the batched queries                                                                                                                                             |
| maxOperationCount | `number`              | The maximum number of operations to be included in a single batch                                                                                                                                                       |
