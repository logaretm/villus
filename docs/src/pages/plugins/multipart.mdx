# File Uploads

Villus has support for file uploads but it is not configured out of the box, So you would need to manually import it and configure it with `villus` client.

The multipart plugin is available as its own package under the name `@villus/multipart`

## Basic File Upload

First add the plugin to your dependencies using `yarn` or `npm`:

```bash
yarn add @villus/multipart
# Or
npm install @villus/multipart
```

Then import the `multipart` plugin from `villus` and make sure it is before the `fetch` plugin:

```vue
<script setup>
import { useClient, fetch } from 'villus';
import { multipart } from '@villus/multipart';

useClient({
  url: 'https://test.com/graphql',
  use: [multipart(), fetch()],
});
</script>
```

And that's it, Now you can use files in your queries/mutations:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <input type="file" name="upload" id="" @change="upload" />
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { useClient, useMutation, fetch } from 'villus';
import { multipart } from '@villus/multipart';

useClient({
  url: 'http://localhost:9000/graphql',
  use: [multipart(), fetch()],
});

const SingleUpload = `
  mutation SingleUpload ($file: Upload!) {
    singleUpload(file: $file) {
      id
      path
      mimetype
      filename
    }
  }
  `;

const { execute } = useMutation(SingleUpload);

async function upload(e) {
  const { data, error } = await execute({
    file: e.target.files[0],
  });

  console.log(data, error);
}
</script>
```

<DocTip type="danger">
  Note that the `multipart` plugin currently is not supported by the `batch` plugin, you can only use it with `fetch`
  and your custom fetchers if applicable.
</DocTip>

## Options

At this moment the multipart plugin doesn't have any options to customize

## Code

You can check the [source code for the `multipart` plugin](https://github.com/logaretm/villus/blob/main/packages/multipart/src/index.ts) and use it as a reference to build your own
