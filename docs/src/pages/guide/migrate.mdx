# Migration Guide

## From 2.x to 3.0

3.0 contains very few breaking changes.

### useSubscription() reducer arguments

For better TypeScript detection with TypedDocuments and more versastility with the reducer function, the argument order has been flipped.

- So instead of getting the previous value as the first argument, you will get the new subscription result instead.
- The second argument will recieve the previous reduced value.

This makes the reducer more flexible as it can now be used as either a callback for when incoming data is received or a mapper if you only plan to use the last result or map it to a different value, or a reducer that combines the previous and incoming values if applicable.

Here is how to migrate:

```diff
- function reduceMessages(old, incoming) {
+ function reduceMessages(incoming, old) {
  // reduce values
}
```

### onSuccess query hook renamed

For consistency, the recently introduced `onSuccess` option on `useQuery` has been renamed to `onData` to be more consistent with other naming conventions.

Here is how to migrate:

```diff
import { useQuery } from 'villus';

useQuery({
  query: GetPostById,
  variables,
-  onSuccess: data => console.log(data),
+  onData: data => console.log(data),
});
```
