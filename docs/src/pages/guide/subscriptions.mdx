# Subscriptions

`villus` handles subscriptions with the `useSubscription` function.

To add support for subscriptions you need to add the `handleSubscriptions` plugin to the `useClient` plugin list, which in turn will call your subscription client. The plugin expects an a function that returns an object that follows the [observable spec](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-observable) to be returned, this function is called a **subscription forwarder**.

The following example uses `apollo-server` with the `subscriptions-transport-ws` package:

```vue
<script setup>
import { useClient, handleSubscriptions, defaultPlugins } from 'villus';
import { SubscriptionClient } from 'subscriptions-transport-ws';

const subscriptionClient = new SubscriptionClient('ws://localhost:4001/graphql', {});
const subscriptionForwarder = operation => subscriptionClient.request(op);

// in your setup
const client = useClient({
  url: 'http://localhost:4000/graphql',
  use: [handleSubscriptions(subscriptionForwarder), ...defaultPlugins()],
});
</script>
```

Once you've set up the `handleSubscriptions` plugin, you can now use the `useSubscription` function.

<DocTip>

You can also use [`graphql-ws`](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws) package for your subscriptions, but you will need to modify your `subscriptionForwarder` to look like this:

```vue
<script setup>
import { useClient } from 'villus';
import { createClient } from 'graphql-ws';

const wsClient = createClient({
  url: 'ws://localhost:9005/graphql',
});
const subscriptionForwarder = operation => {
  return {
    subscribe: obs => {
      wsClient.subscribe(
        {
          query: operation.query,
        },
        obs
      );
    },
  };
};

const client = useClient({
  url: 'http://localhost:4000/graphql',
  use: [handleSubscriptions(subscriptionForwarder), ...defaultPlugins()],
});
</script>
```

## Executing Subscriptions

The `useSubscription` function has a similar API as it exposes a `data` property that you can watch

```vue
<template>
  <ul>
    <li v-for="message in messages">{{ message }}</li>
  </ul>
</template>

<script setup>
import { watch, ref } from 'vue';
import { useSubscription } from 'villus';

const NewMessages = `
  subscription NewMessages {
    newMessages {
      id
      from
      message
    }
  }
`;

const { data } = useSubscription({ query: NewMessages });
const messages = ref([]);
watch(data, incoming => {
  // do stuff with incoming data
  messages.value.push(incoming);
});
</script>
```

## Passing Variables

You can pass variables to subscriptions by passing an object containing both `query` and `variables` as the first argument:

```vue
<script setup>
import { useSubscription } from 'villus';

const NewMessages = `
  subscription ConversationMessages ($id: ID!) {
    conversation(id: $id) {
      id
      from
      message
    }
  }
`;

const { data } = useSubscription({
  query: NewMessages,
  variables: { id: 1 },
});
</script>
```

## Handling Subscription Data

The previous examples are not very useful, as usually you would like to be able to use the `data` as a continuous value rather than a reference to the last received value, that is why you can pass a custom reducer as the second argument to the `useSubscription` function, think of it as a subscription handler that aggregates the results into a single value. The aggregated value will become the `data` returned from `useSubscription`.

Here is the last example with a custom reducer, we will be covering the `setup` function only since the rest of the component is mostly the same:

```vue
<script setup>
import { useSubscription } from 'villus';

function reduceMessages(oldValue, response) {
  oldValue = oldValue || [];
  if (!response.data || response.errors) {
    return oldValue;
  }

  return [...oldValue, response.data.newMessages];
}

const NewMessages = `
  subscription NewMessages {
    newMessages {
      id
      from
      message
    }
  }
`;

const { data } = useSubscription(
  {
    query: NewMessages,
  },
  reduceMessages
);
</script>
```

The `reduceMessages` function acts as a reducer for the incoming data, whenever a new response is received it will be passed to `reduceMessages` function as the second argument, the first argument will be the previous value.

<DocTip>

Keep in mind that initially, we have `null` for the initial value so we needed to provide a fallback for that.

## Pausing subscriptions

Similar to queries, subscriptions could also be paused by passing a `paused` value to `useSubscription`.

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue';
import { useSubscription } from 'villus';

const NewMessages = `
  subscription ConversationMessages ($id: ID!) {
    conversation(id: $id) {
      id
      from
      message
    }
  }
`;

const paused = ref(false);

const { data } = useSubscription({
  query: NewMessages,
  variables: { id: 1 },
  paused,
});

// pause the subscription
paused.value = true;

// resume the subscription
paused.value = false;
</script>
```

Note that pausing or unpausing doesn't sever the established connection (if websocket implementation is used), all it does is ignore the incoming values.
